This is a project that focuses on applying styles to an HTML document using CSS and Flexbox technology.

Flexbox is a layout technique that allows for flexible and fluid layouts with ease.

1. **Creation of the HTML document:** We started by creating a basic HTML document that would server as the structure of our page.

2. **Linking to the CSS stylessheet:** We created a separated CSS file and linked it to our HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

3. **Applications of Flexbox:** We used Flexbox properties such as `display: flex`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content` and `align-items`, to organize and position elements in our layout flexibly.

4. **Custom Styling:** We added custom styles, such as colors, fonts and margins, to enhance the appearance of our page.

The website is published from a GitHub repository.
