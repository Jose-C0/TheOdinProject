# About Project

Simple implementation of the classic "rock, paper, scissors". 

In our user interface, the player can play by clicking on buttons instead of typing his answer in a message. There are three buttons, one for each selection.

Inspired by The Odin Project for the construction of the project I used:

- HTML5 for the structure.
- Use of CSS3 grid and flex to align elements.
- Github to display the page.
- Maintain clean code practices
